## Code Description

The FrankoScalp MT5 Expert Advisor is designed to trade on the EURUSD symbol using a scalping strategy based on moving averages. The code is structured as follows:

### Libraries and Constants

The necessary libraries are included at the beginning of the code, including the Trade library for handling trading operations, the Expert library for Expert Advisor functionality, and the MovingAverages library for calculating moving averages. Constants are defined for the symbol to trade, lot size, stop loss and take profit levels, and a magic number for identification.

### Global Variables

The global variables are initialized, including the CTrade object for trading operations and the CMovingAverages object for calculating moving averages.

### Initialization

The OnInit() function is called when the Expert Advisor is initialized. In this function, the moving averages parameters are set up using the Setup() method of the CMovingAverages object.

### OnTick()

The OnTick() function is called on each tick. It checks if there is an open position using the PositionSelect() method of the CTrade object. If there is an open position, it checks if the price crosses below the fast moving average using the iCustom() method of the CMovingAverages object. If the condition is met, the position is closed using the PositionClose() method.

If there is no open position, it checks if the price crosses above the slow moving average and opens a long position using the Buy() method of the CTrade object. It also checks if the price crosses below the slow moving average and opens a short position using the Sell() method.

### Deinitialization

The OnDeinit() function is called when the Expert Advisor is deinitialized. In this function, the open position is closed using the PositionClose() method.
